# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical data.  
We used a dataset with 80,000 records and applied various models to build a reliable prediction system.

## 📊 Project Overview

- 🔍 **Goal**: Predict whether a person has heart disease or not using medical features
- 📈 **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, KNN
- 📊 **EDA**: Boxplots, heatmaps, pie charts, scatterplots, and more
- ✅ **Best Accuracy**: Random Forest with 89%
- 📄 **Research Paper**: Written in IEEE-style, approx. 10 pages with visuals
